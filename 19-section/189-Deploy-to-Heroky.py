# 189
# Programming Tool/Concept of the Day:
# Web App Deployment - Deploy to Heroku

## Keynotes ##

# Integrated Platforms
# Deploy our Streamlit app to Streamlit Cloud.
# So that was free to do.
# You don't have to pay for the service,
# however you have limitations.
 
# PaaS
# Platform as a Service, also known for short as PaaS,
# and some platforms, some good platforms
# to mention are Heroku, PythonAnywhere,
# Google App Engine, and AWS


# IasS
# DigitalOcean, AWS, Google Could
# Digital Ocean has a better pricing system

# Physical Servers
# Hardest


# In conclusion, I do recommend PaaS
# and now we're going to use Heroku.
# So let's go over to our PyCharm project.
# So that's my to-do app, the web app,
# and we are going to deploy it on Heroku.

# go to the heroku.com website
# Note: you have to create an account
# It's not free!

# email
# password

# authentication method
# Connect an Authenticator App

# BUT, not activate a billing method
# => no try/deploy!
