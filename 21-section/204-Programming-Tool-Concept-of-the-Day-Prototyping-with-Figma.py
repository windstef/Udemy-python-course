# Programming Tool / Concept of the Day: Prototyping with Figma

# new skill:
# how to create prototypes for your apps.

# So what is a prototype?
# A prototype is a preliminary version of your app.
# It's not the app itself.
# It looks like an app, but it's not the app.
# So a prototype is something you create before you code your app.

# For that, we need to use a software
# and the industry standard for prototyping is Figma.
# So please go to your browser, go to figma.com
# and then you want to sign up for a free account on Figma.
