## 247. Programming Tool/Concept of the Day: Using the PyCharm Debugger

### Keynotes:

1. set breaklines
2. check the 'Console' for detecting the error and statements
3. play with debugger buttons for the variables and modules scopes
4. step by step using the debugger button: 'Step Into My Code'
5. button: 'Step Over'
6. button: 'Step Into' (similar to btn 'Step Into My Code' but goes into library as well)
7. button: 'Step Out'
8. button: 'Run To Cursor'
(goes when the cursor is placed, the previous statements are executed without the debugger to stop)
