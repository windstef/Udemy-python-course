The Zen of Python ...
2. "The Zen of Python" is a set of principles about coding in Python.
3. And these principles are more about the style of coding, more from 
a software engineering perspective.

4. "Beautiful is better than ugly."
This first principle advocates the readability.
5. "Explicit is better than implicit."
6. "Simple is better than complex."
7. "Complex is better than complicated."
8. "Flat is better than nested."
9. "Sparse is better than dense."
It's better to split things at different lines.
10. "Readability counts."
11. "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although 
practicality beats purity."
13. "Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced."
14. "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess."
15. "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."
16. "Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch."
17. "Now is better than never."
18. "Although never is often better than *right* now."
19. "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea."
20. "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea."
21. "Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"
