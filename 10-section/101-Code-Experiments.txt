# Code Experiments

# There are two major types of errors in Python.

# You have syntax errors and then you have exceptions.

# So first, the Interpreter checks your code for syntax errors.

# So a logical error (exception), for example, would be something like, if we try to remove an item using
# an index which does not exist in the list,

# >> console:
# a = ['a', 'b']
# a.pop(3)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "/snap/pycharm-community/405/plugins/python-ce/helpers/pydev/pydevconsole.py", line 364, in runcode
#     coro = func()
#            ^^^^^^
#   File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
# IndexError: pop index out of range


# So once the syntax is correct,

# the grammar checker gives the green light,

# then the Interpreter components

# which understands the language,

# goes on and translates the instructions

# into machine language, and then your processor processes

# the information and it gives the output

# on your computer screen.
